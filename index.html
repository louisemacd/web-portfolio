      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p> I am currently a student at Thinkful learning the skills necessary to be a software developer.</p>

      <p> When I was a teenager, I learned a little html and would use that knowledge to create simple websites about things I liked and for school projects. I decided that I wanted to pursue this interest further and turn it into a career.
